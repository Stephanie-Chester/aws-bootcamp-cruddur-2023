Create a Billing Alarm

I created a billing alarm with CloudWatch, I set the threshold to alert me the estimated spend is more than $30 dollars. I did for a 6 hour period, I tried to do 1 day but I received an error that it wouldn't trigger so I have to troubleshoot that.

## Generate AWS Credentials

I setup AWS Organizations so I could have separate OU for this bootcamp, and also created a user account for the bootcamp. I used the + suffix trick to create the account but still have it go to an existing email address that I already have instead of creating a whole new email address. I used the forgot password option to generate credentials for the account, I entered the accout email address in the root user field and selected forgot password.

I also created an IAM user under this organization so I wouldn't be using the root user account for cli access, I generated credentials for the account

## Create a Budget

I have setup my budget for my AWS user account I have designated that I will be using for the bootcamp. For now I have setup $30 as my intial budget, not quite sure how much setting up everything at the end will cost but will adjust as needed.
